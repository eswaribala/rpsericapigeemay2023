Feature:
  As an Apigee platform explorer
  I want to experiment with different API auth schemes
  So that I can understand how they can be implemented

  Scenario: Using a valid API Key
    Given I set api-key header to `clientId`
    When I GET /api-key
    Then response code should be 200

  Scenario: Using an invalid API Key
    Given I set api-key header to foobar
    When I GET /api-key
    Then response code should be 401
    And response body should be valid json
    And response body path $.fault.detail.errorcode should be oauth.v2.InvalidApiKey

  Scenario: [Helper] Obtain OAuth Access Token
    Given I set form parameters to
      |parameter|value|
      |grant_type|client_credentials|
    And I have basic authentication credentials `clientId` and `clientSecret`
    When I POST to /helpers/oauth
    Then response code should be 200
    And response body should be valid json
    And I store the value of body path $.access_token as accessToken in global scope
  
  Scenario: Using a valid OAuth Access Token
    Given I set authorization header to "Bearer `accessToken`"
    When I GET /oauth-token
    Then response code should be 200
  
  Scenario: Using an invalid OAuth Access Token
    Given I set authorization header to "Bearer foobar"
    When I GET /oauth-token
    Then response code should be 401
    And response body should be valid json
    And response body path $.fault.detail.errorcode should be keymanagement.service.invalid_access_token

  Scenario: [Helper] Obtain JWT
    When I POST to /helpers/jwt
    Then response code should be 200
    And response header generated-jwt should exist
    And I store the value of response header generated-jwt as jwt in global scope

  Scenario: Using a valid JWT
    Given I set authorization header to "Bearer `jwt`"
    When I GET /jwt
    Then response code should be 200

  Scenario: Using an invalid JWT
    Given I set authorization header to "Bearer foobar"
    When I GET /jwt
    Then response code should be 401
    And response body should be valid json
    And response body path $.fault.detail.errorcode should be steps.jwt.InvalidToken

  Scenario: Using valid basic auth credentials
    Given I have basic authentication credentials alex and universe
    When I GET /basic-auth
    Then response code should be 200

  Scenario: Using invalid basic auth credentials
    Given I have basic authentication credentials nobody and mypassword
    When I GET /basic-auth
    Then response code should be 401
    And response body should be valid json
    And response body path $.error should be invalid credentials provided

  Scenario: Requesting an unknown path
    When I GET /foobar
    Then response code should be 404
    And response body should be valid json
    And response body path $.error should be no route configured for /foobar
