Feature:
  As an API Consumer
  I want consistent error messages
  So that I can easily debug issues

  Scenario: Unauthorized
    When I GET /protected
    Then response code should be 401
    And response body path $.code should be 401.99
    And response body path $.message should be Unauthorized - Token Invalid
    And response body path $.info should be https://developers.example.com
